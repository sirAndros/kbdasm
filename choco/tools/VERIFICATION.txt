VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.
 
The origin of the embedded plugin can be downloaded from releases
on https://github.com/sirAndros/kbdasm/releases/
and than can be verified by doing the following:

1. Fetch .dll asset of the corresponding version from
   https://github.com/sirAndros/kbdasm/releases/

2. Compute checksum using one of the following methods:
   - Call powershell function 'Get-FileHash'
   - Use chocolatey utility 'checksum'

3. The checksum must match the following:

   checksum type: SHA256
   kbd_ru-us_undead.dll: 6a320418390add54027d111730d8b87809269b8a911a693b77ad769ca760fb44
   kbd_us-ru_undead.dll: 752df617d6e7231716648789ee94e7916bd6a9e59a5ef2ae9ac306ea3aed1049

Likewise, the binaries installed from this package is identical and so must
match the checksum either. You can just install the package and than verify
.dll files in "C:\Windows\System32\" folder.
